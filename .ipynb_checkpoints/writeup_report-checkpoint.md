    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",

    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Model\n",
    "My model architecture is based on a [End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) model developped by Nvidia, which consists of 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./cnn-architecture-624x890.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three convolutional layers are using 5x5 filters while the last two are using 3x3 filters (model.py line 39, 46, 51, 56, and 61).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (model.py line 43, 48, 53, 58, and 63), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (model.py line 36).   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "Dropout layer is not used in this project since any kind of dropout layer will somehow make the car drives out of road.  I ran a 50-epoch training test and didn't see sign of overfitting since both training loss and validation loss are similiar and drop in a very similiar rate.\n",
    "![png](./loss_trend_50.png)\n",
    "Based on the above result, I decided to stop the training at 40th epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters Tunning\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 245).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Training Data\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.  It's worth mentioning that when creating training samples of recovering from left or right sides of the road, you eventually also teach the car to run toward the road side if you run toward the road side and recover from it.  This would add bad driving behaviors into the data set.  To solve this issue, I drived the car along either left or right side of the road and then edit the steering angle with my utility.  Any bad driving behavior will also removed from the data set.  \n",

    "I shuffled the training samples 4 times then split them into two sets.  70% of the samples are used as training sets while 30% of them are used as validation set (model.py line 239)  This is to make sure that I don't train and validate on the same set and causes overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traing data generator (`trainSamplesGenerator`, model.py line 112), I add a small adjustment (-0.06, model.py line 148) to shift the car toward left a little bit to avoid hitting poles at some sharp turns. Steering angle corrections are also added to images taken by left and right cameras.  Images of the right camera are getting a little bit more correction than the left images in order to keep the car away from the poles (model.py line 150-158).\n",

    "After saving the model, I ran the simulator and found the car drives out of road at some spot of track 1 and track 2.\n",
    "This was either casued by bad or insufficient training data.  I removed bad behavior and added more training data.\n",
    "Since all the training data points were recorded at speed of 9 mph, I added a small adjustment (drive.py line 85) proportional to current speed to drive the vehicle better through some sharp turns.\n",

    "\n",

    "I then recorded the vehicle driving along both left side and right side of the road instead of back and forth between center of the road and road sides.

    "\n",
    "![png](./track1_recover_l1.png)\n",

    "After the collection process, I had 584967 of data points. All training data were then preproccessed to cut off portions of sky and the hood.  The size of images then changed from 160x320 to 71x320:\n",

    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 40 as evidenced by running a 50-epoch test (shown previously). I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary. To speed up training time, I also set the batch size to 2048 that just fits into Nvidia RTX-2080 Ti on my linux server. By watching video.mov, we can see the vehicle runs at the center line of track 1 and center line of right lane of track 2.\n",
